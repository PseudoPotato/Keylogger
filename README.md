This project explores the implementation of a Keylogger using two distinct approaches: leveraging Metasploit on Kali Linux and scripting in Python. The Metasploit method capitalizes on an established penetration testing framework to covertly capture keystrokes within a controlled environment, demonstrating the potential risks in cybersecurity scenarios. In contrast, the Python-based implementation focuses on customizability and simplicity, providing a hands-on understanding of keylogging techniques through code. Both methods highlight the ethical considerations and security implications of keylogging, with an emphasis on responsible usage in educational and testing contexts only. This project aims to increase awareness of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and emphasize the importance of robust security measures.
